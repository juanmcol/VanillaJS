# VanillaJS
This is a collection of my Vanilla JavaScript websites.

Not all of them may be fully-developed (styling + interactivty + reactive design).

I mostly want to focus on develping the main features with JS.

This way, I can test out a concept with pure Vanilla JS, then move on to the next one.
